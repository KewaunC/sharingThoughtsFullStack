# sharingThoughtsFullStack

 I wanted to create an app where folks could have an online journey. We all have thoughts that plague us but do we feel confortbale writing them down?

## How It's Made:

**Tech used:** EJS, CSS, JS, EXPRESS, MONGODB, REACT 

I made this with CRUD functionality and I wanted the user to be able to feel safe while sharing the thoughts that they had 

## Optimizations

Currently its just a basic models of EJS, JS and CSS but I plan on working on this project until I am satisfied! I love the abilty to signup, and just start jotting down whats going on in your head!

## Lessons Learned:

CRUD is a bit easier and the backend is definately a different breed but guess what I'm learning and I'm able to explore these different projects and now I can bring things to life.
